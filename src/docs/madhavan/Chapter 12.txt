One day, Vaidehi calls Govindan affectionately.

"Govinda, come here, my son. You are getting older; don't you need to get married? What do you say?" she asked.

Govindan sat in silence without offering any reply.

"Why are you silent, Govinda?"

"Mother, now Kutti Kannan sings so well. He is brilliant in his studies and everything else. Tomorrow, our Kutti Kannan will emerge as the best," he went on.

Smiling, Vaidehi asked, "What did I ask, and what are you answering?"

In the meantime, Madhavan asked, "What are mother and son discussing?"

"It is good that you have come as well. Come, I am speaking about Govindan’s marriage," said Vaidehi.

"So, has that marriage fever caught hold of you too? Once children come of age, it seems like a disease for parents. Look, Govinda, it is between you and your mother. Whatever decision is made, it is fine with me," he said, and walked toward Kannan’s room.

"You know our life well, Govinda. To me, your decision is what matters most. I will not compel you. I will accept whatever you say. But you must speak truthfully. Say what is in your heart. Do not say 'no' now and suffer later."

Govindan held Vaidehi’s feet and wept. "Mother," he cried.

"Get up, my son. What is all this? Why are you crying? God is there, your father is there; you should worship them. Why worship me? That Kannan will not leave you wanting for anything. Tell me, Govinda," Vaidehi said.

"Mother, I was born into an untouchable caste. Your motherly heart accepted me as your own son and treated me as an equal. To this day, you have never let me feel any lack. Even if my biological parents had lived, it is doubtful they would have raised me like this! You have nurtured me with more love and affection than I deserve. Is there a deity greater than you, Mother? I wish to serve both of you for the rest of my life. Even if I serve you that way, the debt will not be cleared. I wish to be born as your son and serve you for many lifetimes. I am so fortunate to live with people of such pure devotion and humanity. Please do not alienate me by speaking of marriage. I only wish to be with you always," he said, weeping as he held Vaidehi’s feet.

"You foolish boy, what has happened to you? You are babbling today. You are always our son; I will certainly not alienate you. In Kannan’s creation, who is high and who is low? If we all understand the Creator well, castes will not come in between. Humanity is the very foundation of devotion. In this world, under the guise of devotees, some commit atrocities out of ignorance. Why do you make us out to be great for that? We are always the servants of that Kannan. It was that Kannan who sent you here. Rather than saying we treated you as a son, the truth is that you did everything as our son. Let the world speak as it wishes; we do not care. In the eyes of that Kannan, we are doing what is right. Do not worry. You are always our son. I will find a good girl suited for you and arrange the marriage. What do you say?"

"Mother, just one small condition. I have no desire for marriage. My only wish is to visit all of Kannan’s holy Kshetras. After that, I will return and serve you until the end of your days. Do not ask me why or for what reason I made this decision; this is my only wish."

"Look, have you thought this through and decided? You must not regret it later in vain," Vaidehi said.

"I have thought it through well. I have faith that Kannan will not forsake me. Mother, when Kannan has played such roles in your lives, will he not protect me? I have absolute faith in him," he said.

"Do not worry, Govinda. Kannan will not leave you with any deficiency. You spoke of high and low in caste; the one with a noble heart belongs to the highest caste. In that regard, you have become greater than us. Do not worry. We will do everything that needs to be done for a son. You can only travel and see places while you are young. So, when do you plan to go?" Vaidehi asked.

"Mother, once Kutti Kannan grows up and takes over the responsibilities, I shall begin my journey."

"So, Vaidehi, is the sermon over?" Madhavan asked as he walked in.

"He is proving well that he is your son. What, are you going to compel him?"

"No, no. I will certainly not make that mistake. Let him do as he wishes." Thus, their lives went on.

Kutti Kannan excelled in everything. He was outstanding in character, devotion, honesty, and righteousness. He secured a good job. He was also excellent in singing. Considering his mother and father as his gurus, he lived according to their word. He revered his father as a deity. Though wealth began to flourish now, there was no change in them.

Govindan spoke to his parents. "Kutti Kannan has taken over all responsibilities. I do not understand what to do with the shop. Someone is asking for the shop; shall I sell it to him?"

Interrupting the conversation, Kutti Kannan said, "No. That shop was built by the hard work of Father, Mother, and Brother. We can let someone look after it. After you return from your travels, you can manage it yourself. Let the shop always remain ours."

Vaidehi remained silent. Madhavan said, "I don't know, do as you please," and went into Kannan’s room.

"Mother, what our Kutti Kannan says seems right. We have two people working now; we can ask one of them to look after it. Let Kutti Kannan check the accounts occasionally. I intend to leave tomorrow morning," Govindan said.

"Brother, do you have enough money? If you write a letter from wherever you are, money for your expenses will reach you. Without worrying about anything, you must complete your pilgrimage peacefully and return here. I have only one small request: you must come back here. You must stay with me until the end. Swear this before Kannan and then depart," said Kutti Kannan.

"I will certainly come, my boy. I still have services to perform. I will definitely come and stay with you. Do not worry, I swear I will come as you say. I will never leave my brother."

Vaidehi remained silent. "Kanna, the one you sent is departing. He is coming to see you. Kanna, be his companion without any hindrance until he returns."

The next morning, after bowing to both his parents, Govindan departed. Vaidehi watched him leave with tearful eyes. Madhavan stood there, not knowing what to do. Kutti Kannan felt the sorrow of having no one to speak to him with such affection and help. Govindan went on his pilgrimage. Everyone became occupied with their respective tasks.

Many days passed since Govindan left. One day, Madhavan was sitting in Kannan’s room. "Kanna, have you still not shown mercy to me? How much longer must this go on? Do you still not realize that I yearn for your Darshan? Why this agony, Kanna? Am I such a great sinner? Even if I am a sinner, would you not come to destroy a wicked demon? Similarly, would you not come at least to destroy me? Why such a delay with me? What mistake am I making? Is this life to pass away just like this? You, who have performed so many miracles, is it fair for you to withhold your Darshan? I am getting older; do you not see that either? Look at me a little, Kanna, I who live only for you," he wept in distress before Kannan.

Vaidehi, who happened to pass by, was pained to see Madhavan weeping. "Kanna, he yearns only for your Darshan. Why such a delay for that? We too are getting older. We yearn, not knowing what to do next. You have left us in the middle of a forest and are watching the fun; is what you are doing fair? Or have you appeared many times and we failed to notice? Is it not human nature to be confused? At least now, give us Darshan in a way we can understand. Is it not your doing to make us not understand? When one surrenders to you in pure devotion, are not all their actions like yours? That being so, are you not the one keeping us in ignorance? Why such a delay, Kanna? My heart cannot bear to see him yearning for you. Lord, if my presence is the reason he does not receive Darshan, then take me away immediately or I shall go elsewhere. Give him your Darshan. I cannot bear the agony he suffers. Kanna, what you are doing is not right. Show at least a little pity on us, Kanna. All this time we have lived only for you. Show mercy at least for the little time that remains. I have faith that you will not forsake us. That faith must not go in vain, Kanna," she thought, looking at Madhavan.

Noticing someone standing there, Madhavan turned around. "Come, Vaidehi. Why are you staring at Kannan?" he asked.

Vaidehi walked in slowly and said, "Nothing, I was just looking at our Kannan."

"Vaidehi, have we committed many sins? Is that why he does not grant Darshan?"

"Please, do not say with your own mouth that you have committed sins. Perhaps I have. I am the one who has been a hindrance from then until now."

"No, Vaidehi. You are no hindrance to me. In fact, it is because of you that I am able to show more devotion. I will not blame you. Our story is like parents who have lost their child. What can we do, Vaidehi? Will we get Darshan or..."

Madhavan’s mouth was suddenly covered by her hand. "We will certainly get it. Despair should not set in. They say faith decreases as age advances; that is for ordinary people. That state should not happen to you. Do not let go of faith. Why would our Kannan not come? Even if he doesn't, just as Savitri fought with Yama, I will fight with Kannan and make him stand before you. Please do not lose your determination. It is because he has great affection for us that he plays with us. Perhaps he is lost in your devotion. Who else would he have such affection for, if not you?"

"Will that Kannan definitely come, Vaidehi?" Madhavan wept like a child.

"He will definitely come. He is definitely going to see us. Do not cry." Thus, a mental struggle continued between the two of them.
