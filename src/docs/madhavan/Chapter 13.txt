One evening, Kutti-Kannan sat deep in thought. Vaidehi watched him and wondered what was on his mind. She gently stroked his head and asked with affection, "What is it, Kannan? What is worrying you? Why do you look so troubled?"

"Amma, I have a desire in my heart." "Tell me, son. If it is a righteous desire, we can fulfill it by the grace of Krishna." "You are the one who must decide if it is righteous or not, Amma." "Don't confuse your mind needlessly. Get to the point."

"Amma, I need a lot of money." "What kind of crazy desire is this?" she asked. "Wait, Amma, let me finish. Our father is so devoted to Krishna. I want to demolish this house, buy the neighboring houses, and build a beautiful temple with a grand idol of Krishna." "Why buy the neighbors' houses? What we have is enough."

"Don't be in a hurry, Amma," he continued, lost in his vision. "On one side, there will be rooms for Krishna’s devotees to stay, worship, and eat. On the other side, our home. Krishna will be in the center, surrounded by a lush garden (Nandavanam) full of blooming flowers. Father will worship Him, and I will sit before Krishna and sing, losing myself in music."

Vaidehi snapped, "And am I even alive in this plan or not?" "Don't joke, Amma! You will be there, welcoming every visiting devotee with a smile and feeding them. Our brother Govindan will oversee everything. Tell me, is this a righteous desire or not?"

"Your desire is noble in one sense," she said, "but you are talking about luxury instead of being content with what we have." "Amma, I am not doing this for fame or for the public. I am doing this for my father. Once it is finished, I want to publish a book about his pure life story. He is the very definition of devotion. And you, Amma, are the definition of service." His voice trembled, and he began to cry.

Vaidehi comforted him. "Don't worry. Everything will happen according to Krishna's will. If He desires this, He will make it happen." "I am not worthy to advise you, but it's not about whether He desires it; we must bring Him here! For this, I will accept many music concerts. I will work day and night, earn the money, and fulfill this goal. The effort is mine; the fulfillment is His duty. If I have your blessing, Amma, I can conquer the world. Now tell me, is my desire righteous?"

"I don't understand anything, son. It feels like you are pulling your father back into worldly ties. My mind is not clear enough to say what is right or wrong. Do as you wish. But tell me one thing—and don't be angry—are you planning to get married, or will you immerse yourself only in this temple work?" "Amma, you have started talking like an ordinary mother!" "I'm not forcing you, just asking your opinion. You have such big dreams; don't you need someone to share your responsibilities?" "Amma, I haven't thought about it yet. I haven't decided if I want to marry or not. When I do, I will tell you."

Vaidehi went into Krishna's room. "Kanna, what is this game? The father longs for your vision, the son wants to build a temple. Where do I stand? Should I pray for my son, my husband, or myself? I have nothing to ask for myself; you are everything to me. As for my son, he is your 'Prasadam' (gift); you will look after him. But my husband... give him your vision soon. Let my son do as he likes, but my husband won't be part of that worldly grandeur. And wherever he is, I will be. Don't let my son’s words enchant us away from the true path of devotion."

She then told Madhavan about Kutti-Kannan’s plan. Madhavan didn't say yes or no. "What is your opinion?" Vaidehi asked. "Let him do as he wishes. Let it happen by Krishna’s grace. I have nothing else to say." "But he wants to build a temple and make us live there!" "Why worry about that now? Let whatever Krishna intends happen."

Months passed. Kutti-Kannan worked tirelessly, performing concerts and earning wealth. He eventually bought the two neighboring houses. Vaidehi prayed, "Kanna, you help him so quickly when he asks for material things for a temple. But for the man who has done penance for years to see you, you show nothing! Are you a selfish actor? Give us a conclusion soon."

One day, a wealthy man arrived at their house in a carriage, followed by a servant carrying a tray of flowers and fruits. Vaidehi wondered who he was. Usually, Kutti-Kannan met people in a room near the shop, not at home.

The man was clearly very rich, adorned with rings and jewelry. "Madam," he said, "I am a wealthy merchant from a nearby city. I am a devotee of Krishna, and I am entranced by your son's singing. I attend every one of his concerts. My daughter, Radha, often comes with me." "It is all Krishna’s grace," Vaidehi replied modestly. "Aha! You prove you are Kutti-Kannan's mother—so humble. I would be honored to form an alliance with such a family. I want to give my daughter in marriage to your son."

Vaidehi was silent. What is this new development? she thought. Kannan said nothing about this. She explained that her husband was at the river and her son was out. The man spoke cleverly, "Then say that you like the proposal. Your son has already seen and spoken to my daughter; I don't think he will say no."

When Madhavan returned, Vaidehi whispered to him in the puja room, "Someone is here to see Kutti-Kannan. Stay here in prayer until they leave; I will explain everything later." "Is there a problem?" Madhavan asked. "No problem. Krishna won't lead us into trouble."

Kutti-Kannan arrived and greeted the man. "Why have you come all this way, sir?" "It's about my daughter Radha’s marriage. It's as if the groom is already found," the man smiled. "Who is the groom?" "You are! I am here for your consent."

Vaidehi asked her son, "Do you know him?" "Yes, Amma. He sits in the front row at all my concerts and has recommended me for many performances." "And do you know his daughter?" "I've seen her. She comes with him."

Kutti-Kannan told the man, "Sir, I think it would be difficult for me to be your son-in-law." "Don't say that. I am a Krishna devotee, and so is your father. I have only one daughter." "But sir, I haven't even thought about marriage yet." "What is there to think? Make a decision. I will return in two days," the man said and left.

Vaidehi asked her son, "What is all this?" "I don't understand, Amma." "You said she is beautiful and sings well. Does that mean you like her? Be honest, we won't stand in your way." "I said she is beautiful, but I don't know her character. How can I agree without knowing her? Her father is rich, but I don't know what kind of devotee he is." "The father doesn't matter as much as the girl. Do you want to get married?" "Amma, don't take this wrongly, but now I feel a desire for it."

"You fool, what's wrong with that? It's natural. Follow your heart." "I want to marry and have a son like my father, and let him see God according to his own will," Kannan shared his dream. "Don't overthink it. If you like her, marry her. Leave the rest to God." "I'm just afraid... will I get a wife as supportive as you are to Father?" "That’s idle talk. You must lead your wife on the right path. Now, what about Radha? We need to answer in two days." "Amma, why don't you go and see the girl once?"

"Listen, Kannan, you like her but you're just confused. My seeing her won't change your heart. If you truly like her, say so, and we will agree. It's not right to marry someone else and regret it later." "Amma, I like her, but I’m scared of how they will treat us." "If you like her, say yes. We will leave the rest in Krishna’s hands."

Vaidehi went to the puja room. "Kanna, he has desire in his heart but is struggling to say it. He seems to like this girl. Bless their life. I feel it's right for him to marry the one he likes, even if I didn't particularly like the man who came today. I won't stand in my son's way. I place this marriage proposal at your feet."

She then sat with Madhavan and told him everything, admitting she wasn't entirely happy with it. "Did you tell him you're not happy?" Madhavan asked. "How could I? Once I knew he liked her, it wouldn't be right to discourage him." "Children sometimes make mistakes without knowing. You should explain it to him. If he still wants it, let it be." "I don't think he will listen to me on this." "Should I talk to him?" Madhavan offered. "No, no, you stay out of it. I will handle it."

The two-day deadline passed. In the middle of it all, she hadn't yet found the right moment to speak to Kutti-Kannan again.
