**Chapter 16**

Madhavan was walking toward the ashram. He ran to see his Guru, who was also waiting expectantly for Madhavan.

"So, Madhava, do you finally know the way to come here now?" the Guru asked.

"Sir, please forgive me," Madhavan pleaded, falling at his feet in worship.

"I shall learn all the details about you through your wife. She will send money and letters every month. Alright, what are you holding in your hand, Madhava?" the Guru questioned.

"Sir, it is an idol of Kannan," he said, showing it. 

"The same idol you have held since you were a child? Have you still not let go of this? Go, place this idol in the sanctum and return. Tomorrow morning, your initiations and instructions will take place. Until then, take some rest. Do not worry about anything," the Guru said.

Madhavan did not have the heart to leave Kannan in that room. He stood there, lost in thought. *Can I not keep Him with me? Can I even sleep without this Kannan? I cannot even imagine it. Yet, I cannot disobey the Guru’s word. What is he going to do for me tomorrow? Perhaps he will show me that real Kannan? What should I do? I understand nothing.* Holding Kannan, he continued to ponder in the same spot. The Guru was watching him.

"Madhava, why are you just standing there? What are you thinking about?" the Guru asked.

"It is nothing... if it is alright, may I keep Kannan in my room for today?"

"What is this, Madhava? This is childishness."

"My worry is how I will sleep if I leave Kannan."

"Madhava, does Kannan reside only in this small doll? Kannan is the Omnipresent (Vishvavyapi); He pervades everywhere. We must realize Him. If you realize Him, you will know that He is right before us. For devotion, the first steps are faith and the need for a form. Once absolute faith is established in that form, the desire to know more about it is triggered. Once that desire is triggered, it prompts the way to seek Him. To the one who has realized, everything is a form of Kannan. No matter what form Kannan takes, such a person can understand. It is not certain that the Divine will come in only one form, Madhava. To help a pure devotee, He will come in any form; it is the devotee’s sagacity to understand that. Do not confine the Lord within this small idol, Madhava. See Him in your heart. Realize Him. Know that He resides within you. Why, Madhava, have you not understood this? I gave you instructions suited for your childhood. As you grew, that devotion should have overflowed. It is not right to remain in the same state. We must also perform whatever service we can for the devotees. We should not harbor ego or arrogance. If we look upon everyone with love, the Lord will look upon us with love.

Madhava, there is much to be accomplished through you. Wisdom will come to you on its own. First, let go of that Kannan. Place Kannan in the sanctum and come meet me here tomorrow morning around five o'clock."

Madhavan asked in a soft voice, "Will Kannan grant me a vision?"

"Madhava, this is a childish question. There is always value for your pure devotion. He has given visions to many through you, and He will continue to give visions to many more because of you. He is conducting a play using you, child; understand that well. Kannan is always with you; it is you who are unable to understand Him. A thin veil of ignorance (Agnana) hangs over you. If you remove it, you will realize that Kannan is within you. Go, Madhava, do not worry. Kannan’s grace and my blessings are always with you," the Guru said and walked ahead in silence.

He was calling many people and telling them something. They were talking as if there was a grand festival the next day. Madhavan understood nothing. He went toward the sanctum and placed Kannan there. As he placed Him, a sense of longing and weeping overcame him. *Kanna, this is the first time I am parting from you. As the Guru says, please remove my ignorance. From today, give me the mental strength to be away from you. Alright, I am going to my room. You stay here comfortably, but do not forget me,* he said, prostrated, and went to his room.

Upon arriving, his mind was deeply troubled. He sat thinking for a while. *What can be done? What will the Guru say tomorrow? Will Kannan grant us a vision? We have left Kannan there; should we go and take Him back? Should we take Him and run away without the Guru knowing? No, no, that is not right. That would be a betrayal of the Guru. He was the one who showed us Kannan. It is not right for us to do that. What can be done?* he wondered. As he thought, everything that had happened from the moment he first met the Guru until today came to his memory. While thinking thus, he drifted into sleep without realizing it.

At four o'clock in the morning, there was a knock on the door. Madhavan started and opened the door. The person standing outside said, "The Guru asked you to bathe, finish your chores, and come."

Madhavan did not understand anything. "Alright, I am coming," he said. He finished his tasks and set out toward the Guru.

He was told the Guru was in the Mandapam (hall). Madhavan headed toward the Mandapam. Along the way, many people looked at him and prostrated. Madhavan was bewildered. *Where did this crowd come from? Why are they prostrating to me?* He understood nothing. He came and worshipped the Guru.

The Guru said, "Come, Madhava." He took him to a private place. There, a person stood holding a ritual pot (Kalasam). He handed the pot to the Guru, gave him a new set of clothes, and left.

The Guru bathed Madhavan with the water from the Kalasam. He removed Madhavan's clothes and told him to wear the saffron (Kavi) robes. Madhavan understood nothing; he felt the Guru was doing something mysterious. He had the thought that if all this was done, Kannan would appear.

The Guru brought him to the Mandapam. Addressing everyone, he said, "From today, he is your Guru. He will take over all these responsibilities. I am appointing him here and leaving for the Himalayas. From today, his name is Bhagavathathethendran. The explanation for this will be clear to you in the future. He held the Lord within his grasp; the Lord Himself is contained within his hands. This is the current explanation. The Lord has merged into his devotion. There is very little difference between him and the Lord. You are all blessed to have such a Guru. You will understand all these words I say in the future. All the respect given to me must be given to him," he said and seated him on the throne (Asanam).

"From now on, he will also take care of our Krishna. No one should act against his word," the Guru concluded.

Everyone prostrated to both the old Guru and the new Guru. Madhavan felt as if he would go mad. *What is this? Until now, I have not taken on any responsibility. Is this the responsibility of guiding the people? Kanna, I myself have not yet matured; from where will I preach to others? What happened to this Guru? He is doing something unnecessary. Kanna, I came to see you, but what is this new twist? Is it not enough that you played with me all these days? I am afraid even to think about it. Will I succeed in this great responsibility?* Suddenly, a thought dawned in his mind: *All this is Yours; You Yourself shall lead all of this.* As soon as he sat on that Guru Peedam (seat), the ignorance within him began to slowly fade away on its own.

The Guru departed after two or three days. Within six months, Madhavan began to manage the responsibilities beautifully and gradually. His life story served as a guide to many, and he continued to give spiritual instructions. He had no thoughts of son or wife; he renounced everything. Yet, the affection he had for that small Kannan remained.

One night, by chance, there was no one in the ashram. Those who were there had fallen asleep in their respective rooms. As usual, Madhavan was sitting in the Mandapam at night, performing his chants (Japa). A thief grabbed Madhavan. "Where is that idol? The gold idol? Give it here!" he demanded.

Madhavan struggled as much as he could, saying he could not give it. "It is right here in the sanctum, isn't it? I will break in and take it," the thief said and ran toward the sanctum.

Madhavan blocked the way to the sanctum. The intruder grabbed him and pushed him away. Madhavan fell and lost consciousness. Slowly, he regained his senses. He looked toward the sanctum; the locks had been broken. He stood up in panic. "Has our Kannan's idol gone? Kanna!" he cried. He slowly tried to open the sanctum. The door was bolted from the inside. He beat against the door. "Don't! Don't take it! There are many things here; they are all public property. Come out respectfully!" he shouted. There was no movement. He knocked on the door three times and beat his head against it. There was no answer. "Kanna! Kanna!" he shouted loudly, knocking on the door.

To his great astonishment, the door opened by itself. A light emerged from within, so bright he could hardly look. "Kanna!" he screamed. Just as he had always desired, with the flute at His waist, one hand on His hip, and the other beckoning him to come, stood the same small child's face—a beautiful smile, lips like red lotuses, beautiful soft eyes, a peacock feather on His head, earrings in His ears, wearing new silk clothes, and beautiful feet with anklets on His tiny toes. Looking at Madhavan, He said, "Come, Madhava, let's play."

Madhavan stood there for a moment, completely losing himself. "Why, Kanna? Why did you make it so late?" he asked. "Kanna, I am your slave forever. You have given me that for which I have waited all this time! My Lord, you must always be my companion. What else would I ask for besides you? What else do I know besides you?" he said, washing Kannan's feet with his tears.

"Madhava, rise. From today, I will be with you whenever you call. If you ask me questions, I will answer you; let that be of use for the worldly life of the people. I will be with you at the time you call; do not worry. Your birth is for the service of the world. After completing it, you shall reach me," Kannan said and smiled. Madhavan embraced Kannan. He fondled Him to his heart's content. He danced with joy, realizing the day he had waited for had finally arrived.

With this, the first chapter concludes.
