During the lunch hour, as Vaidehi was serving food to Madhavan, she heard the voice of Kutti Kannan. For a moment, she wondered if it was an illusion, but Kutti Kannan came running to her, calling out, "Amma!" Govindan explained how Kutti Kannan had been with Krishna and recounted what he had told Krishna, though he remained silent about the vow he had taken. Looking at Madhavan, the boy asked, "Appa, why did you leave me and come away?"

"Appa did not leave you behind; he sent Govindan immediately to bring you," Vaidehi replied. Somehow, the family was reunited once again. Vaidehi praised Govindan from the bottom of her heart—not just for finding the child, but for the way he spoke to Krishna without betraying her husband. "Oh Krishna, You unite good people only with those who possess true devotion. Even if they are wicked, they turn righteous by Your mere glance. Oh Krishna, how can I describe You? How can I praise You? There are no words enough to extol You. Was it for this purpose that You sent Govindan to us that day? Not just in this birth, but in however many births I may take, I must remain engaged in Your service. No sorrow shall befall one who serves You, and even if it comes, You resolve it," Vaidehi prayed, praising Him in many ways.

Turning to Madhavan, Vaidehi said, "From today, Govindan is our child. Everything that belongs to Kutti Kannan belongs to him as well." Madhavan agreed wholeheartedly.

It was impossible to understand what was happening! What divine plays (leelas) Krishna performs! The two had become four, living together in love. As their wealth and prosperity grew, Vaidehi continued to offer food to the devotees of Krishna. There were times she even yearned, wondering if at least one devotee would visit. Their days were passing peacefully.

Kutti Kannan was now about ten years old. He would go out to play and now had many friends. One day, while playing, the other children said, "Our families are going to buy Vinayagar idols tomorrow." Hearing this, Kutti Kannan remained silent. When they asked, "Isn't there one in your house?" he didn't know what to say and replied, "I must ask my mother."

Kutti Kannan returned home that night and asked his mother, "Will you buy a Vinayagar tomorrow?"

"For us, Krishna is all the gods, dear. You worship Krishna," Vaidehi said.

"No, I want Vinayagar," Kutti Kannan insisted stubbornly.

"Tomorrow, you may take Krishna and decorate Him however you wish," she suggested.

"Will you let me touch Him tomorrow?" he asked.

"You may do everything without even needing to worry about not touching Him," Vaidehi replied.

"Fine, I will do exactly as they do at my friends' houses," he said.

"Alright, do not worry now. Go to sleep," she said. In the morning, Kutti Kannan visited all his friends' houses, observed what they were doing, and began to do the same. In his imagination, Krishna was Vinayagar that day, and he performed all the rituals according to his desire. He asked his mother to prepare the same offerings (neivedhyam) that the others made. Vaidehi prepared everything, fulfilling her son’s every wish. Two days passed this way. On the third day, Kutti Kannan went to everyone's house and saw that the Vinayagar idols were gone. Upon inquiring, he was told they had been immersed in the river, as the idols should not be kept at home for long.

He returned home and thought deeply. "Everyone else has immersed their idols in the river, yet we have kept this one since I was small. I must immerse this in the river today; it shouldn't stay in the house." He wondered how to take it, fearing his father wouldn't allow it. Then, an idea struck him. In the afternoon, his father would sleep near Krishna, while his mother and Govindan would be at the shop. He decided to take Krishna then and throw Him into the river. Around three o'clock, he quietly took the Krishna idol. Madhavan, fast asleep, knew nothing. He carried Krishna a long distance, threw Him into the river, and ran back.

When Madhavan woke up and looked, Krishna was not there. He was terrified. He searched everywhere, crying, "Where is our Krishna? Where has our idol gone? Where could Krishna have gone?" He began to wail, "Krishna, where have You vanished? You have separated from me!" He struck his head against the wall. "Have You left me? I lived happily just by looking at Your face. Krishna, where are You hiding? Do not leave me! I cannot exist without You!" He screamed like a madman, over and over.

Vaidehi, who was looking after the shop, felt a sudden sense of unease. She asked Govindan to watch the shop and rushed home. She found Madhavan weeping and beating his head like one possessed. Seeing him cry like this, she stood confused. Looking at Vaidehi, he sobbed, "Our Krishna has suddenly vanished. He has left us, Vaidehi! Has He truly left? Is the mischievous Krishna performing a miracle, or has He truly abandoned me? I don't understand. Is there any point in living in this world after Krishna is gone? I certainly will not remain. Where is my Krishna? Will He return, Vaidehi?" he cried out in agony.

Vaidehi looked at the empty pedestal where Krishna had been and began to sob loudly. "What game is this? Why are You testing us like this? If there was a flaw in our devotion, punish us, Appa! Correct us! But where did You go, leaving us behind? How will our lives go on now? You would usually come running the moment we called! Come now! Come to me, considering me Your own mother, Krishna! Please do not go anywhere leaving us. Without You, there is no breath in us. Everything happens because of You. How can You, who knows everything, let this happen? Do not leave us!"

Both of them sat weeping, not knowing what to do. Kutti Kannan slowly walked inside. Seeing his parents, he wondered, "Why are they crying? Those who immersed Pillayar at my friends' houses didn't cry. Why are only these two weeping? Is there some other problem?" He ran and hugged his mother. She was barely conscious of her surroundings. He shook her, calling, "Amma! Amma!" Vaidehi opened her eyes and sobbed, "Your Brother is missing, dear!"

Confused, Kutti Kannan asked, "Is it Govindan?"

"No, your Brother who was inside is missing," she cried.

"Oh, is that all, Amma? You were the one who said Krishna is everything. On the third day, everyone immersed their idols in the river, so I took Krishna and immersed Him in the river too," he said.

"What have you done!" Vaidehi cried out and beat Kutti Kannan severely.

Madhavan stopped her, saying, "Don't hit him, Vaidehi. He is just a boy. He did it out of ignorance. The fault is ours. We must go and find that Krishna. Show us where you threw Him in the river." The three of them rushed to the spot. Kutti Kannan pointed to the place where Narayanan and Madhavan used to bathe. "The water flows from here to there; that's where I threw Him," he said, pointing to the very spot where he had once threatened to throw Narayanan.

Madhavan wailed loudly. Vaidehi realized it was impossible to retrieve anything from such fast-flowing water. "Krishna must choose to return on His own. Until He comes, I will not move from this spot. You take Kutti Kannan and go home. Do not stay here; go home!" Madhavan shouted.

Vaidehi replied in a loud voice, "That day when the child was lost, I stayed home with the confidence that you would bring him back. Today, when you yourself are lost in grief, with what confidence can I go? Until You return to this mother on Your own, I will not drink a drop of water. I will remain without eating anything. If this is the punishment for those who are devoted to You, let it be. If it is true that we live only for You, then You must return. I will wait for You and die here. This is my vow." She then took Kutti Kannan back home.

"Don't cry, Amma. Brother will surely come back. I threw Him in without knowing. He will come back for me. It's scary to see both of you like this," Kutti Kannan said, hugging her and crying.

She hugged him back, weeping. "Let your words be the truth. You have realized the mistake you made in ignorance. He will surely come. Krishna will never forsake us. He will surely come."

Madhavan lay on the riverbank all day. Neither the cold nor the wind affected him. His only agony was the absence of Krishna. He rolled on the ground and wept, not knowing what to do. "Where are You, Krishna? Somehow, please come back. Where are You? Why are You testing me like this? Do You truly have no compassion for me? Come quickly. I cannot even imagine a life without You." The night passed in this manner.

At around five in the morning, someone woke Madhavan. It was a boy who looked like a fisherman. Though his skin was very dark, he was exceptionally handsome.

"Why are you lying here, sir?" the newcomer asked.

"Who are you, son?" Madhavan asked.

"My name is Machagan. I am a fisherman," he replied.

"Why did you wake me?" Madhavan questioned.

"No reason, sir. You looked so sorrowful. I woke you to ask what the matter was," he said. "It's nothing. How could you possibly understand my pain?" Madhavan replied.

"I will help if I can. Tell me. It is not good to lie on the river sand like this for no reason," Machagan said.

"It doesn't matter. I will just stay here and perish. Even that Krishna has no heart," Madhavan lamented.

"Who is Krishna? Is he your son who ran away from home in anger?" Machagan asked.

"Why do you speak like this? Try to understand my grief," Madhavan said.

"Well, how can I understand if you don't tell me anything?" Machagan countered.

"Even if I tell you, what will you understand?" Madhavan asked.

"Why this useless talk? Tell me, I will surely help," Machagan insisted.

"Fine, listen. My Krishna's idol fell into this water. It fell right there, in the middle of the flowing river."

"Alright, how big was it? You say 'idol'—how large?" he asked. Madhavan showed with his hands, "A small figure, about this size."

"Oh, is that all? Is this why you are making such a fuss? If that one is gone, why don't you just buy another one?"

"Don't speak without understanding. That idol is Krishna Himself. It is not a toy as you think," Madhavan said.

"Alright, who is this Krishna you keep talking about?" Machagan asked.

"Krishna is God, son. I have worshipped Him since I was a child. His glory is boundless and indescribable. He is the one who took ten avatars, and so many more. He dwells in pure souls. He values pure devotion. He always protects those who trust Him and is always with us. There is so much more to say. It is difficult to make you understand," Madhavan explained.

"You say He is everywhere and has taken ten avatars. Is He only in that doll? You just said He is in the heart! Then why are you searching for this doll? If He is someone who comes the moment He is called, then call Him! Let Him come out of the river," Machagan spoke mockingly.

"Enough! Stop! Why do you speak so defiantly?" Madhavan snapped.

"I am not saying anything wrong. I only repeated what you said. If He is everywhere, shouldn't we just realize that?"

"I am a broken man. I cannot exist without Him, son," Madhavan said.

"Fine, so the doll is what matters to you."

"Yes, son, the doll is what matters to me. Can you retrieve it for me?" Madhavan asked.

"You said it was in that spot, right? You pray to your Krishna. It's probably stuck among the rocks. I'll go get it." He dived into the water and did not surface for half an hour. Madhavan became terrified. "Krishna, what is this? The one who came looking for You is also missing! Has he stolen You away? He spoke so much and now he is nowhere to be seen. Nothing should happen to him, Krishna. Otherwise, his parents will hold me responsible. Krishna, please come back!" As he was thinking this, Machagan suddenly surfaced. He signaled from a distance, but Madhavan couldn't understand the gesture. After a while, he came closer. "I had a very hard time retrieving it, sir. Did you really make such a fuss for this tiny doll? You could ask anyone to make a doll like this. Keep a spare one just in case."

In the joy of having Krishna back, Madhavan said nothing to him.

"Sir, why do you have such a childish attachment to this? You are an elder who claims to know everything. Why so much desire for this?" he laughed heartily.

"Go away, son. What do you know of His glory?"

"Yes, yes, you are the ones who know His glory. Then why didn't you dive in and take it yourself? Shouldn't you have believed this doll would save you?"

"Son, forgive me. I do not know how to swim. I was afraid to enter the water. That is why I asked you to get it."

"Once we commit to something, we must be brave enough for everything. But how would you understand? I have to go catch fish. I came here to see if I could catch any. This 'fish' won't be caught today; I'll come back another time," Machagan said, preparing to leave.

"What do you want, son? You have done me a great favor. Have a meal before you go. I will give you plenty of money if you want," Madhavan offered.

"Sir, you have not understood me correctly. I did not come for money. I helped because you looked so miserable. I didn't get what I came for. What can I do? I must leave. I will tell you only one thing: do not place so much desire on this doll, and then you won't have to suffer," he said as he walked away.

Madhavan thought to himself, "He is a madman, a mere fisherman. What does he know?" In the joy of finding Krishna, he hurried home. Vaidehi was busy with the morning chores for Kutti Kannan and Govindan.

Seeing Madhavan approaching quickly, the joy on his face told her that Krishna had been found. "Kutti Kannan! Govindan! Krishna has been found! Appa is coming!" Vaidehi cried.

"Krishna is found!" Madhavan announced.

"How? How?" she asked in wonder.

"I will tell you all that later. First, make arrangements for the morning puja. Also, invite many Krishna devotees for a feast this afternoon," he said, giving a flurry of instructions.

"I will do everything. You go and bathe," she said.

"Today must be special for Krishna. Govindan, do not go to the shop today. We must perform bhajans," Madhavan said, overflowing with excitement.

Seeing Madhavan's happiness, Vaidehi prayed, "Thank You, Krishna. Without You, he is nothing. You are him, and he is You. You are playing a drama for the sake of the world. Whenever he suffered, You have helped. At the same time, You have heard this mother's voice as well. In however many births I take, I want to be the wife of such a pure devotee. I want to live every life in Your service. If not, let this life reach Your holy feet. So much is in my heart, but I have no words. Our God, never leave us. Especially, never leave him. If I ever have to be separated again, let my soul reach Your feet that very instant." She wept as she prayed, "I cannot endure that hellish pain of yesterday again. From now on, You are everything. Lead us with mercy on the right path."

Watching all this, Kutti Kannan realized, "This Krishna idol is the most important thing in our house. I must never throw it away again. Even though I threw Him away, He came back!" His affection for the idol grew immensely. Govindan, observing everything, prayed, "Krishna always listens to pure devotion. If our request is just, He will support us. I too will serve You with great devotion. I have understood well. For the rest of my life, there is nothing but service to You."
