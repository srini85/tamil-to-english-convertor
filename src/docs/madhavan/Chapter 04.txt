Madhavan’s peace was shattered. His mother lamented daily at home, and Madhavan, at a loss for what to do, began to hate even coming home. "Kanna, won't you give me your vision? Why are you trapping me in these family ties? Won't you show me a way out? How do I escape their hands?" he cried bitterly before the idol.

His mother was adamant about the marriage proposal. His father remained indifferent, acting as if he would accept whatever happened. Madhavan had hoped his father would intervene and tell his mother to drop the matter, but he stayed neutral. Madhavan stopped opening his shop regularly and neglected his business. He spent his time sitting in secluded spots by the riverbank. He stopped coming home on time and barely ate, drowning in mental agony.

One morning, after performing his daily rituals for Krishna, he slipped away to the riverbank without a word. He sat in solitude, weighing his options. Confusion grew, but no resolution came. His mind grew weary with overthinking as the sun began to set.

Suddenly, someone touched Madhavan’s shoulders. He turned to look. It was a beautiful young man, about his age or slightly older. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and well-built. He had a gentle smile and a gaze that seemed to hold the whole world. His face was so captivating that once you looked at him, you couldn't help but want to look again.

"Madhavan, don't you recognize me?" the stranger asked. "No, I don't understand," Madhavan replied. "You've forgotten me so soon! I studied with you when you were a child in that other town. Don't you remember?" Madhavan looked closely but shook his head. "No, I don't recognize you." "Fine, let it be. I was your classmate," the stranger said. "How did you end up here?" Madhavan asked. "Wandering from town to town is my job. But why are you sitting here by the river? Where is your home?" "My home is in the town. I just came here to sit," Madhavan said. "You look troubled," the stranger noted. "Yes, I have one trouble after another," Madhavan sighed. "Tell me what it is. I'll help if I can. If it's a matter of love, tell me—I’ll settle it. I fought for my own wife and brought her with me; I can do the same for you. Don't worry about it!"

"Sir, I bow to you, but my problem isn't that," Madhavan said. "Then what is it? Tell me!" the stranger asked in a commanding yet friendly voice. "My family is forcing me to get married."

The stranger burst into loud laughter. "That's it? Just get married then!" "That is the problem, and you’re telling me to do it anyway?" Madhavan asked. "What, don't you like the girl?" the stranger asked softly. "Please, leave me alone," Madhavan said wearily. "The problem is that I don't want to get married at all." "Then don't get married," the stranger replied simply. "But the people at home won't let it go!" "In that case, get married," the stranger said.

"Are you playing games with me?" Madhavan snapped. "Do I have time for games? I came because you looked sad. You say you don't want marriage; your family says you must. Follow your own will." "But I am lost in confusion," Madhavan said. "Tell me, what is the actual reason you don't want to marry?" "Since you keep asking... I love Krishna. Since I was a child, my only longing is to see Him." "What does that have to do with marriage?" "If I marry, I'll be trapped in the illusion (Maya) of family and children. I have no interest in that."

"If you're so disinterested, why don't you just run away?" the stranger challenged. "If I run away, my parents will wander everywhere searching for me." "Let them! You are going for what you want. They will wander for a while and then settle down," the stranger said. "Wouldn't that be selfish?" Madhavan asked. "We do what we need for ourselves. Those who do good will reap good results. Where is the selfishness in doing what you love? Do what you like. Why don't you go to that Guru who visited your house?" "My parents would follow me there too. I don't want to go there," Madhavan said.

"Listen, either do as your parents wish or do as you wish. You are old enough to know right from wrong. Think it over and decide. Besides, have great devotees never been married? One can be married and still be devoted. If you want to satisfy your parents, get married, but keep your devotion complete and unwavering. Anyway, it's getting late for me. Make a decision quickly; staring at the river won't help. If you walk one way, you'll reach the river's source; if you walk the other, you'll reach where it joins the sea. Choice is yours: the beginning or the union? I'm leaving now, Madhavan," the stranger said and walked away.

Madhavan watched him go. Where have I seen him? He appeared out of nowhere, spoke like a great sage, gave me advice, and left. I don't even fully understand what he meant. He sat in silence for a while. Finally, he made a firm resolution: I will marry for the sake of my parents, but I will not seek fulfillment in it. I will follow my own path. My devotion will not diminish. Kanna, you must always be my companion. Whether my action is right or wrong, you must show yourself to me.

He returned home with this decision. He decided not to say anything immediately but to observe the situation first. After washing up, he went into Krishna's room and finished his evening prayers.

His father called out, "Madhavan, come here. I need to talk to you." Here we go again, Madhavan thought. Don't they have anything else to do? Always advice. He sat beside his father. "Madhavan, you haven't opened the shop in four days. What's wrong?" He's asking as if he knows nothing, Madhavan thought. "Nothing, I just didn't feel like it," he said aloud. "Business will suffer this way." Let it suffer! Maybe then you'll let me go, Madhavan thought, but said, "I'll go from tomorrow." "Good. You should come with me to learn how to buy stock. I can't manage it along with my office work anymore." He's putting even more responsibility on me, Madhavan thought, remaining silent.

Then his father said, "I'm thinking of quitting my job. The commute is hard, and I might get transferred. We have our own house and your shop now. I like this town." "You'll give up everything else, but you won't give up on me," Madhavan thought bitterly. "When I retire, I'll get some money. Tell me, what do you want?" the father asked. "Don't do anything for me; just do what you want," Madhavan thought, staying silent. "I'll keep some money for the two of us and use the rest to go on a pilgrimage to all the temples. I've set aside some for you too—what should I do with it?" "Father, I don't want anything," Madhavan said.

"Alright, let me tell you something you'll like," the father said. Madhavan looked up in surprise. "When we visited the Guru, he mentioned wanting to build a hall (Mandapam) in front of the Krishna temple for bhajans. Shall I give your share of the money for that? I've saved some from your business profits too. Shall I send it all? You'd be happy with that, wouldn't you?" Don't send me away, just do these things, Madhavan thought. "I'm very happy, Father," he said, wondering what the catch was.

The next day, Madhavan opened the shop. Customers asked why he had been closed. He just smiled and worked. Then someone asked, "Is it true they are looking for a bride for you?" They won't leave me alone even here, Madhavan thought. Who told them? "I heard you're the one refusing," another said. They know everything! I hate these idle gossips. This is all my mother's doing, he thought, remaining silent.

An elder man approached him. "What's your problem? You're handsome, you have a shop, a house, and you're an only son. People will line up to give you their daughters. Just pick a good girl and get married." My life is so important to this old man, Madhavan thought. At his age, he should be meditating on God instead of gossiping.

Later that afternoon, a retired officer approached the shop. "I have three sons and two daughters. All are married except my youngest daughter. Once she is settled, my responsibilities are over," the man explained. "What does that have to do with me?" Madhavan asked. "I spoke to your mother. A friend of mine lives on your street and told me all about you. Your parents are good people, and I heard you are a good son. I have approached your mother several times about my daughter, but she said you don't consent. I am old and have traveled many times for this. Please, have some compassion and say yes. Your mother has my daughter's photo. I have to go out of town now; give me a good answer when I return." The man left before Madhavan could reply.

Madhavan was fuming. Why does this old man keep pestering me? Are there no other boys in this world? Kanna, whenever I ask for your vision, something blocks it. Was this what my father was hinting at? I must go and confront my mother.

He closed the shop and went home. "Amma!" he shouted. "Why are you yelling, Madhavan?" his mother asked, coming out. "Who is this old man?" "There's no old man here," she said innocently. "Amma, don't play with me. Someone came to the shop today asking for a marriage proposal."

"Oh, that? He's been here many times. I told him you wouldn't marry, but he kept bothering me, so I told him to go talk to you at the shop. Did he come? What did he say?" "He told me everything," Madhavan replied. "And what did you say?" "I said nothing." "Poor people, look at the struggle of those with daughters. They travel so far to find a good match," she said. "As if I'm the only good boy in the world," Madhavan snapped. "What am I supposed to do? I didn't go looking for him. Everyone who passes by asks why you aren't married. It's all because of you. I told them my son doesn't want to marry right now. In a town, this is how it is. You should have given him a proper answer. I'm not interfering," she said, then went inside and brought a small photo. "Here, look at this. It's a photo of that man's daughter."

"You just said you wouldn't interfere, and now you bring a photo?" "I say that, but can I just leave it? You are my son. I can't even show my face in town because of the talk. At least for my sake, say you like this girl. That poor old man has come so many times. If I had died sooner, you wouldn't have this problem," she began her usual crying.

Madhavan sat by his Krishna. I must end this. I have to manage them somehow. That old man looked so pitiable. "Kanna," he whispered, "I am saying 'yes' only for this situation. Your vision is my priority, not this marriage. I agree only for their peace of mind. She will live in this house, but I will not touch her." He made this vow.

He went to his mother and told her twice, "Amma, this marriage is only for your sake." His mother, not understanding his internal vow, was overjoyed and immediately set to work on the wedding.
