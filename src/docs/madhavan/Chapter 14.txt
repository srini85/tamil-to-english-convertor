**Chapter 14**

The next morning, after finishing her prayers, she came outside.

Kutti Kannan approached her with a smile. "Mother, I have given them my consent. That was the reason for the delay yesterday," he said. Vaidehi was speechless; she stood there, completely stunned.

"Why are you standing like that, Mother? You were the one who told me to give my consent if I liked the proposal." Vaidehi composed herself and asked, "Did you think it over well before agreeing?"

"I made this decision only after thinking about it deeply for an entire day," he replied.

"Why, Mother? Do you not like this?"

"It is not about what I like or dislike, Kannan. Your wish is my wish. All I want is for you to live without any sorrow," she said, suppressing her tears as she went inside.

Kutti Kannan felt a slight pang in his heart. He sensed there was something on his mother’s mind. He understood that she was giving up something for his sake. Following her inside, he asked, "Mother, did you tell Father?"

"I told him, my son. He has never stood in the way of your wishes. Why would he stand in the way of this? If that is the case, tell me your wish, Mother."

"You are the one who is going to get married; what wish could I have, my boy?"

"No, Mother, there is something in your heart. Please tell me," Kutti Kannan said, taking her hand.

"For some reason, my heart is not settled with this alliance. At the same time, it is wrong to stop you from following your desire. Speaking as an elder, I was wondering if their status would be compatible with ours. But you gave your consent before I could say anything."

Amudhan (Kutti Kannan) held her feet and said, "Mother, it is not too late even now. I shall say no. If not this Radhai, another Seethai will come. You are the most important person to me; I will act according to your wish."

"Kannan, get up. As long as our Lord Kannan is with us, we will lack nothing. I didn't tell you my thoughts earlier because I didn't want you to take it the wrong way."

"I will certainly never take you the wrong way. I shall go and tell them today."

"I thought we could think it over and then speak. Now that you have already given your word, it is not right for us to say no. We shouldn't let them cause you trouble in the future. If the girl is good, there will be no problem."

As they were speaking, several carriages arrived and stopped. The wealthy man arrived with traditional gifts and pomp, followed by many prominent people.

Vaidehi looked at Kutti Kannan; Kutti Kannan was looking at Vaidehi.

"What are the mother-in-law and the groom discussing?" the man asked as he walked in.

"Please come in, have a seat," Vaidehi said.

Kutti Kannan whispered to Vaidehi, "Mother, I shall tell them 'no' right now."

Before Vaidehi could open her mouth, the visitor said, "I have fixed the date for the wedding and arranged the halls. Once the families exchange the *taamboolam* (betel leaves and nuts), the matter will be settled."

Vaidehi scolded her son in her mind. *He is a fool; I don't know why he had to hurry. Now he is unnecessarily inviting trouble,* she thought. "I shall go and bring him," she said and went into Madhavan’s room. Once inside, she bolted the door and told her husband everything that had happened.

Madhavan said, "What your son did was a mistake. But it is not right to drive away those who have come to our doorstep. Let Kannan show him the right path."

"No, our eldest son Govindan hasn't arrived. Let us postpone the wedding until he comes," Vaidehi suggested.

"Have you gone mad? Whether it is today or some other day, he must marry the girl he gave his word to. You said you didn't like it, didn't you? You who have managed me all these years can surely manage the girl who is coming. Come quietly, let us prostrate before Kannan, leave it to His will, and exchange the *taamboolam*."

Kutti Kannan waited to see what decision his parents would reach. Even if his father said no based on his mother's word, it would be fine. Though Radhai seemed like a good person, if not her, there would be someone else. *Why couldn't this man find any other place? Why is he hovering around us? There is no problem with my mother; she will adapt to whoever comes. Why did I hurry?* he wondered.

Vaidehi and Madhavan came out with forced smiles. "Please come, sit. Let us exchange the *taamboolam*," they said. The visitor suggested, "We can exchange it in your puja room." Vaidehi did not like the idea of letting them inside at all. Everyone entered the puja room. Madhavan pointed to the idol and began, "This Kannan..."

Vaidehi gently pressed his hand. Understanding her gesture, Madhavan said, "This Kannan is our family deity." The visitor interrupted, "I too am a devotee of Kannan. I have donated a lot of funds to many Krishna temples and fed many people. I have a much larger idol at my house, adorned with the nine gems and diamonds. That too will eventually belong to your son," he boasted.

Vaidehi thought, *Who asked him all this? Kannan, please protect my son.*

"Alright, let's get on with the task," the man said, as if he didn't like standing there. The *taamboolam* was exchanged. Eventually, the *thali* (wedding thread) was tied around Radhai's neck. Kutti Kannan and Radhai sought blessings from everyone. Madhavan had brought the Kannan idol in his box. This was the first time their house was locked. Those who attended the wedding went to eat. Everything was filled with opulence. Their arrival felt like Kuchela entering the court of Krishna. Vaidehi couldn't help but smile.

Madhavan looked at Vaidehi and asked, "Why are you laughing?"

Vaidehi was surprised that for the first time, he was asking her why she was laughing. "It's nothing, I'll tell you later," she said.

No one seemed to be paying attention to them. "Come, Vaidehi, let's go," he said.

"It is our son's wedding. Let's eat before we go and bless them wholeheartedly," she said.

"Yes. Will he not come with us anymore?" he asked.

Vaidehi didn't know what to say.

At the entrance of the wedding hall, there was a commotion. Vaidehi gently asked someone, "What is happening there?"

"Someone has come claiming to be from the groom's side. He looks like a thief. He certainly can't be from the groom's family."

"Wait, let me see who it is," she said anxiously and hurried over.

*Who could it be? Could Govindan have arrived? Are they driving him away? Oh God, that shouldn't happen. This shouldn't happen to my Govindan,* she thought as she ran.

The crowd moved aside, seeing the groom's mother approaching.

She went near. A middle-aged man was standing there. He wore a bright white dhoti around his waist and a towel draped over his shoulder. He wore a religious mark (*naamam*) on his forehead. He was very dark-skinned and had an appearance that was generally unappealing to onlookers.

Upon seeing Vaidehi, he asked, "Where is Kutti Kannan, Mother? Where is Madhavan?"

Vaidehi didn't know who he was. *Whoever he may be, he knows my husband's and son's names,* she thought. "Please come inside," she said.

Seeing her lead him inside, the wealthy relatives remarked, "What a bunch of beggars."

Vaidehi heard this. *Kannan, you must take care of this,* she thought with a heavy heart as she led him in.

Madhavan, Kutti Kannan, Radhai, and Radhai's father were standing there. The man ran and hugged Madhavan, shouting loudly, "Madhava! How are you?"

Radhai's father hit his forehead, thinking the man had no sense of respect.

Madhavan also hugged him and asked, "I am fine, are you well?" while wondering in his mind who the man was.

Looking at Kutti Kannan, the man said, "Hey boy, you didn't even invite me to the wedding!"

"Forgive me, I don't even know who you are," Kutti Kannan replied.

"Me? I am very close to your family. I have come to listen wherever you perform. Don't I know that you sing for that Kannan in the temple?" he spoke on.

"Ah! You are a great devotee!" Kutti Kannan said and prostrated before him. "Come, let us all go and eat. None of us have eaten yet."

Radhai's father felt embarrassed. *Good grief, do I have to sit and eat next to this man?* He called the groom aside and said, "If your parents want, let them eat with this man. The wealthy guests are waiting; you can eat with them."

Kutti Kannan grew angry. "What is this? Should I leave my parents and this devotee to eat with the wealthy?" he spoke loudly.

Vaidehi, sensing what was happening, said, "You go, Kannan. You go with them. I will go with these people. Don't worry."

"Mother, am I mad to dance to their tunes? He said he was a great devotee, yet he refuses to sit with a devotee."

"Does he look like a devotee to you? He looks like a thief," Radhai's father said.

"If you call someone associated with us a thief, then what does that make us?" Kutti Kannan retorted.

"He doesn't look like a devotee; he looks like a thief. He has none of the qualities of a devotee!" Radhai's father shouted.

"What do you know about the qualities of devotion?" Kutti Kannan shouted back.

"Oh, so you are a great devotee? Your father is a great devotee? Go on! What do you people know about devotion? My daughter said she wanted to marry you because she was enchanted by your singing, and that's why I came to your doorstep," Radhai's father ranted.

When he spoke about his father, Kutti Kannan became furious. "Yes, don't say anything about my father!"

"Yes, yes, your father is a 'great' man," Radhai's father mocked further. The argument intensified. Vaidehi didn't know what to do. She couldn't stop them. She turned to look at Madhavan. He and the visitor were laughing and talking together. Seeing her husband laughing like that, she remained quiet.

The fight here reached its peak. "Go away! Keep your daughter and your wealth to yourself. Don't commit villainy in the guise of devotion!" Kutti Kannan shouted. "Come, Mother, let's go."

"You have tied the *thali* around the girl's neck. Bring her with you," Vaidehi said.

"Radhai, if you wish to come, come with me. Otherwise, stay with your father," he said.

"Radhai, he is ready to hit me; what is the guarantee he won't hit you? Don't go," her father said.

Radhai didn't know what to do. She didn't understand what was happening. She felt dizzy, as if she would faint.

"Come, Mother. If she wants to come, let her come to the house herself," he said, pulling her along. "Father, come. Sir, you come too," he called the visitor.

The visitor said, "I didn't come to eat. There is another wedding nearby; I must go there. My work here is done," and he left swiftly.

*What is this? He is leaving as if he didn't understand anything that happened. Who invited him to eat anyway?* Vaidehi was confused.

"The work is done," Madhavan said and started walking. He carefully carried the small box containing Kannan. Madhavan didn't ask why the daughter-in-law hadn't come; that thought wasn't even there. He placed Kannan in his room. The house was silent.

Six months passed this way. Radhai would meet Kutti Kannan occasionally. Both struggled, unable to make a proper decision. Vaidehi was troubled. Every day, she prayed to Kannan to show Kutti Kannan a way. She prayed not just as a mother, but out of human compassion.

Madhavan, unconcerned about anything, continued his struggle for a divine vision. One day, a voice called out to Madhavan, "Come." Madhavan woke up and looked around. There was no one. Thinking it was an illusion, he lay down again. "Madhava, come! How much longer will you delay?" the voice said. Again, there was no one. He waited intently to see whose voice it was.

"Mother, Mother!" Kutti Kannan called out as he approached Vaidehi. "Until now, I have been singing the songs you wrote about Kannan at the end of my concerts. I get a lot of applause for them. I sing them well with *raga alapana* and *swarams*. By your blessings, those songs are excellent."

"Alright, what is it, Kannan, at this time of night?" Vaidehi asked.

"It's nothing, Mother. I have run out of songs. Tomorrow is the consecration (*kumbhabhishekam*) of a Krishna temple. Mother, please write a new song for me to sing tomorrow."

"What, Kannan? Have I ever written them myself? I wrote them all through your father's blessings and the grace of that Kannan. How can you ask me to write so suddenly?" Vaidehi said.

"Mother, I want a new song through you tomorrow."

"Why are you being so stubborn now, Kannan?"

"Mother, Mother, just this one for me, Mother."

"Alright, for your sake, I shall sing with that Kannan and your father in my heart. The raga is Madhyamavati, the tala is Adi Tala. Write it down," she said.

As she sang the song, Vaidehi shed tears.

"Mother, why are you writing such a poignant song when I asked for one?" Kutti Kannan asked.

"My boy! I have never asked Kannan for anything until now. Your father only wants a vision (*darshan*). Today, I don't know why, my heart feels that this life is enough."

"Mother, why are you grieving like this? You must live for a long time. I have never seen a virtuous woman like you in this world."

"Enough, Kannan. Don't praise me too much. It is all the grace of that Kannan. Look there, your father got up twice looking for someone. Now he is lying down again. My heart is in great pain. I fear he has started searching for Kannan even in his sleep. If anything happens to him, I won't be able to bear it," she cried.

"Why does that Kannan test him so? Why does He put someone who thinks only of Him through such hardship?" Kutti Kannan interrupted. "Mother, don't worry. Kannan will surely show His grace. Nothing will happen to Father. By the way, who was that man who came to my wedding? I wanted to ask, but I never got the time."

"I don't know, son. If he knew your father, he must certainly be someone known to him. He spoke so happily that day."

As they were talking, Madhavan called out, "Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Come here!"

Vaidehi, terrified because he had never called her like that before, ran with tears in her eyes. Kutti Kannan ran behind her. *Kannan, let nothing happen to my husband,* she prayed as she ran.

Vaidehi entered Madhavan’s room.

"Vaidehi, I heard the voice twice. I looked closely to see where it came from. Since I didn't catch it clearly, I waited for the third time. On the third time, I listened intently—our Guru is calling us. Vaidehi, I don't know why, but my heart longs to see him. Start at once."

"Did you hear the Guru's voice? Did our Guru ask you to come? How wonderful! What is there to prepare? We can leave just as we are."

Seeing his mother and father talking, Kutti Kannan, fearing they would leave in the dark, said, "Mother, leave after daybreak. Where will you go in the night? I will certainly come with you in the morning."

"Why should you come with us now? You have many concerts tomorrow. Start building the temple for Kannan. We will stay at the Ashram for a month and return," Vaidehi said.

"What you say is right, Mother. I have accepted many concerts. There is a lot of office work. There is no one else at the shop. So, you go see the Guru and come back soon. Tell the Guru about the temple work and ask him to come for the installation. Don't worry about these things; I will take care of them. You can leave around four in the morning; it is midnight now," he said.

"Vaidehi, I will leave only if I take Kannan with me," Madhavan said.

"It's only for a month, Mother. Why? I will take care of Him," Kutti Kannan said.

"He will go to concerts, he will go to the office, and the house will be locked. My Kannan will not stay in a locked house," Madhavan said.

"Kutti Kannan, what your father says is right. Let Him stay in his hands," Vaidehi said.

"Alright," Kutti Kannan agreed, "but you both must return in a month."

"What is this, a condition? We will come," Vaidehi said.

Madhavan went and sat near Kannan. "Kannan, only today did I hear the Guru's voice. Because of that, I have gained the hope that I will see You soon. Grant a vision to me and to Vaidehi, who has served both You and me. For the first time in my life, I am asking You today—we both must reach Your feet together," Madhavan prayed.

Vaidehi said to Kutti Kannan, "Why don't you bring Radhai here for a few days while we are away?"

"Mother, she doesn't say anything clearly. Apparently, all the properties are in her name. She thinks if she comes here, it will look like we are after the property. That's why she hesitates. I asked her why she couldn't write off the properties for charity and come. She said nothing can be done until her father passes away. She hasn't decided anything properly, Mother; she keeps talking back and forth. I have made a vow that I will not touch her until she comes here, bows to both of you, and serves Kannan. I told her that too. She is crying. Let her leave everything and come. Don't worry, Mother," Kutti Kannan said.

"What have you done? You are in a hurry for everything. She doesn't need to come and serve us; she doesn't need to do anything. Let her be with you and help build that Kannan temple."

"So be it, Mother. Let her come before the temple is built. Let her come on her own. I will do as you say."

"You shouldn't punish the woman you married with such desire. What can she do for the mistakes made by elders? She is also in a fix. Ask her to come and lead a proper life."

"Mother, you go and come back first. Don't worry about that. She will surely come."

Thus, the mother and son talked all night. This was their first such conversation.

It was four in the morning. Madhavan and Vaidehi prepared to leave with Kannan. At that moment, there was a knock at the door. Kutti Kannan went and opened it. Someone Kutti Kannan knew was standing there. "What is it?" Kutti Kannan asked.

"It's nothing. Govindan will be back in a week. I just arrived from out of town. I saw the light in the house and thought I'd let you know before going," the man said and left.

"Mother, Mother! Brother Govindan is coming back! Why don't you all go after he arrives? It feels hard to send you both away," Kutti Kannan said.

"Once we have decided to leave, we leave. Kannan is with us. When Govindan comes, take good care of him. Do not abandon him until the end. Do everything he needs. Do not forget that he is your elder brother," Madhavan said.

Kutti Kannan and Vaidehi were amazed. They were happy that he, who had never spoken much, was saying such things now.

Vaidehi added, "I have transferred all the money in my name to Govindan. Give it to him when he arrives. You have this house; Govindan has the shop. Install a small idol of Kannan soon."

"You are going for just a month and will be back. Why are you saying all this, Mother?"

"We are both old; we don't know what will happen," Vaidehi said as she and Madhavan departed.
