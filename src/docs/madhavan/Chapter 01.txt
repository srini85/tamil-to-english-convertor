A mother and father were good-natured and religiously minded. They had a son, about seven years old, named Madhavan. He was as intelligent and obedient as other children, though sometimes he was stubborn.

A great sage was the guru of this family. The sage was not old, but middle-aged. One day, news came that the sage was coming to their house. There were many solemn ceremonies at home. Madhavan did not understand anything and went to his mother and asked, “What is special?”

She said, “Madhav, our guru is coming.”

He said, “Who is the guru? Why should he come here?”

“Don’t bother me, ask your father,” she said.

He asked his father the same question, “Who is a guru?”

His father, who was busy with very important matters, found it was not easy to explain to him. He thought he should explain something simply, so he explained it temporarily by saying, “An uncle with a beard will come to our house. He has seen Kannan in person. If we all worship him, Kannan will come to us in person.”

Madhavan was now walking around, inside and outside. He was looking at the gate frequently. He was thinking to himself, “When will this bearded uncle come? How will Kannan be? I should ask. Will Kannan come to play with me? I should ask. It would be great if this bearded uncle brought Kannan! How will that Kannan be? I feel like playing with him.” He was suffering with all this longing in his mind.

The saint finally arrived at their house. All the elders were performing foot worship and offering food. Madhavan felt angry inside. “All the elders are going to him and saying that they will not let me go to that bearded uncle! This bearded uncle is also a bad person and will not see me. They are all talking about something, but no one has heard anything about Kannan! This bearded uncle is the one who invites such people. He says that he will not see me,” he argued in his mind.

All the offerings were over and everyone went to their respective houses. The saint went to rest. Madhavan also went behind him. Madhavan's mother looked at him and said, "Madhavan, let Guru rest; he has come from such a long way. Today you must keep your tail down and not make any noise. You have not eaten anything since morning—come and eat."

The Guru also looked at Madhavan and said, “Go and eat.”

“No, I don’t want anything,” said Madhavan.

Understanding the child's intention, the Guru said, “I will take you alone in the evening. We can go to the temple and play in the park there. Come, now you go and eat.”

The Guru went to rest. “I don’t want any food,” Madhavan said to his mother. He sat silently on the steps, thinking, “It seems that they won’t let me know about the mirror! Food is food! What if I don’t eat for a day? Why does this bearded uncle need to rest? What if he talks to me for ten minutes? He talks about everything that is unnecessary and won’t tell me what is necessary!”

His mother’s call came again, “Come and eat."

“Okay, let’s go eat, we’re hungry too. Bearded uncle said he’ll meet us in the evening, so we can ask him then,” he said to himself and went to eat.

In the evening, the Mahan and Madhavan were heading towards the temple. The Mahan was asking Madhavan about his studies and friends. Madhavan reluctantly came up with some answers. At Krishna’s temple, they both finished their darshan and came to sit in the park.

Madhavan said to the Mahan, “Bearded uncle, Mama, I like you very much.”

"Sariyappa, you are playing. I am going to do a trick."

Madhavan went to pluck a beautiful flower there. The Mahan immediately said, "Don't pluck the flower; it will decorate Krishna."

Madhavan ran over, thinking this was the opportunity, and said, "Bearded uncle, have you seen Kannan?"

"Why are you so suspicious, father?"

"Will Kannan come with me?"

"He will definitely come. If you call him with confidence, he will come."

"If I call him and he doesn't come!"

"We shouldn't think like that at any time. He will definitely come and play with you one day."

"Well, how will Kannan be?"

"Kannan will be a naughty boy like you."

"I definitely want to see him, Mama!"

“Don’t worry, just keep thinking about him. Don’t give up on your studies! You should keep studying and at the same time keep thinking about him within yourself.”

“Will he really come, uncle? Can I trust you, uncle?”

“He will definitely come. Just be confident as I said. Don’t lose hope no matter how relaxed you are. He will definitely come to see you. Okay, come—the work you came for is done. Let’s go,” said the uncle.

“How did you know that I was going to ask you all this?”

“The work you came for is done, my dear!”

The sage got up and started walking, smiling inwardly. “Lord, I have planted the seed. Now I need to water it and make it grow into a tree, producing flowers, fruits, and berries. This is your work.” They both walked silently, praying in their minds.

Madhavan and the sage reached home. The sage stayed there that day and left the next morning. The sage called everyone and said, “I am going on a pilgrimage; I am going to visit many places on foot. I will go from village to village and stay there and give teachings. Finally, I will set up an ashram in a village and everyone can come and meet me. I am coming, Madhavan—am I going?”

He said goodbye and accepted their invitation. The next day, as usual, Madhavan was leaving for school.

“Mother, you said that bearded uncle's Kannan would come. Will he definitely come, mother?”

“Whatever the bearded uncle says will happen. Definitely, Kannan will come. Don't worry, go to school,” she said. She didn't think he would be so worried; she thought he was asking for something to play with.

When Madhavan came home from school in the evening, the first question he asked was, "Did Kannan come?"

“Kannan will definitely come; you go and play and come back,” she said.

This continued every day. Madhavan kept asking if Kannan had come, and even half asleep, he would wake up and ask why Kannan had not come yet. Madhavan, while going to school, would suddenly look back. He was not playing much in games and was wondering why Kannan had not come yet. His mind was gradually losing interest in anything.

Seeing this, his parents did not know what to do. They were thinking of what to tell him to make him understand. Madhavan, on the other hand, asked everyone he met in every city whether Kannan would come. He was wandering around like a madman. The parents' anguish increased.

Madhavan, who had not eaten or slept properly, suddenly went to bed. He was adamant that he would not eat anything unless Kannan came. As the days passed, his body became thin and tired. Doctors came and examined him, only for Madhavan to ask if Kannan wanted to come.

Madhavan looked at his mother and said, “Mother, I am not going to open my eyes. I will not open my eyes until Kannan comes. I won't!"

Seeing all this, the mother's heart was pounding. She didn't know what to do. Madhavan didn't eat or open his eyes for two days. Madhavan's mother went to the Krishna temple there and said, "Let's make a decision. Let's leave that Krishna alone. Let's see what he does."

Madhavan's mother went inside the temple, prayed to the Lord, and cried heartily. The priest came and said, "Isn't your child still okay?"

"No, sir. That Krishna has to answer for this. He has to answer for whether he will live or not!" she said while crying.

Then a hand gently touched her shoulder. A middle-aged woman was standing there, very beautiful with a "Lakshmi hand."

“What’s wrong? Why are you crying like this?” the woman asked.

Madhavan’s mother told her everything that had happened and cried.

“Is that all? Let’s both go and see Madhavan,” the woman said. They both set off, the woman carrying a bag on her shoulders.

On the way, Madhavan’s mother asked, “Who are you, mother? You have come to help me after hearing my complaint!”

“Me? My name is Mother. My husband is a villager. I go from village to village. I will go around—stop worrying about me and come and see your child.”

Both of them entered Madhavan’s house. Madhavan’s mother looked at him and said, “Look who has come, open your eyes and see.”

“Tell me if Kannan has come, otherwise I can’t.”

“Ah! How stubborn you are at this age! You are a child who doesn’t know anything!” the visitor said, sitting down and stroking his head.

Madhavan thought for a moment, “Who could this be? How beautifully she speaks! Should I open my eyes slowly and see? No, I shouldn’t open my eyes until Kannan comes.”

“Madhavan, I have come here only because Kannan told me to look at you,” said the lady.

“Did Kannan tell you?” He opened his eyes in surprise. When Madhavan saw her, he thought in his mind that whatever she said must be true.

The woman said, “Our father sent me. He asked me to come and see you and tell you some things—that’s why I came running. You are sitting there without eating anything; get up and let me give you food!” She took the prasad and started feeding him. Madhavan started eating without saying anything.

Madhavan, who had eaten half of his food, asked, “How is Kannan?”

“He must be very handsome; he has captivated everyone’s hearts,” said the woman.

“Did Kannan say he would come to see me?”

“He has never abandoned anyone who trusted him. He will not abandon you either; he will definitely come to see you.”

“Then why hasn’t he come yet?”

“That’s the answer he sent me. He said, 'A stubborn boy is waiting for me. I have a lot of work and a lot of devotees are coming. You go and tell him that I will come whenever I get some rest.' So he will definitely come, don’t worry, Madhavan!”

Hearing this, Madhavan said, “Yes, you are saying that... but is Kannan greater than you?”

“Our Kannan is greater than the great, smaller than the small. He who is smaller than you is greater than me,” she smiled.

“Why do you say 'our' Kannan? Say 'my' Kannan,” Madhavan insisted.

“I said 'our' Kannan because I, you, and your mother are here. Okay, let it be yours. Shall I leave now?”

Madhavan’s mother said, “Mother, you came like a god and saved my child. Thank you very much. It has been many days since he smiled and ate. Because of your kindness, he is now able to see and talk! Give him good advice before you leave.”

The woman smiled and said, “I was ordered to see him. Why thank me for this? Everything goes to that Lord. Madhavan, you must behave like a good child. You must study properly. You must not be stubborn anymore.”

“Of course, mother.”

“It is enough if he comes for you. Okay, I will give you something until he comes. Here, I will give you the idol that I worship every day,” she said, handing over a one-foot-tall idol. "If you feel like seeing Kannan, look at this idol. You should keep this very safe. Do you think Kannan is there now? Shall I go, Madhavan?"

Madhavan brought her to the door. He stood with the idol, watching her until she reached the street corner. The woman, Mother Ramma, walked on, smiling to herself. “God, I have watered the seed; now it is up to You to do the work.”

Madhavan was looking at the way she went. “How good Amma is! She has seen Kannan! She has even given Kannan’s doll to me!”

“Madhavan, you shouldn’t keep that doll in your hand all the time. Keep it in our puja room. You shouldn’t take it out often.”

Madhavan kept it in a good place inside and kept looking at it often.

“You haven’t gone to school for ten days; go to your friend’s house and borrow books,” his mother said, sending Madhavan away.

“Okay Amma, I will come quickly. Until then, you take care of Kannan!”

On the way, he saw his father. “Father, father, Kannan has come! Go home and see! I will be back soon,” he said and ran away.

The father entered the house and looked at his wife with great surprise. She told him everything that had happened and showed him the idol of Krishna. Madhavan’s mother said, “It is because of this Kannan that our Madhavan survived, and therefore we both are indebted to Him. From tomorrow onwards, you should bathe this Kannan with water and decorate it with flowers and keep this room divine. I will also make offerings twice a day with devotion.”

Madhavan came running back at a fast pace. “Dad, did you see him?”

“I saw him, Madhavan. You should also study properly from now on. Know that Kannan is with us. Behave like a good child, or else Kannan will leave.”

Madhavan smiled and said, “Dad, this is not Kannan. A mother said that if I was keeping this, the real Kannan would definitely come.”

“Okay, let it be as you wish. If you behave well, that Kannan will come to see you.”

Night time came. Madhavan said to his parents, “Shall I sleep where Kannan is today?”

“No, Dad, you are going to be scared; you are a little boy.”

“No, I will lie down here. I will lie down near him.”

“Okay, do as you wish,” they said.

Madhavan lay down, and after a while, he woke up. “I am the only one lying down; you are the only one standing—lie down!” he said to the idol. He checked if his parents were looking and laid the doll down next to him.

“No, if Mom and Dad see, they will call me a bad boy. You will also stay away,” he said, and placed the doll back in its place. “Kanna! You must come. I will wait for you,” he said and went to sleep with a little longing.

Contrary to the custom, Madhavan’s father woke him up a little earlier and bathed him. Then he too bathed and came to bathe the idol.

“Dad, are you going to bathe my Kannan?” the boy asked. “Shall I do it?”

“No, you are small. I have to bathe you! Therefore, you can’t bathe this doll yet. You can do it when you grow up a little. Now, go to school.”
